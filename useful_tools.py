# List

# Store multiple items of the same or different types in one variable
# Format: my_list = [item1, item2, item3,....,last_item]
# Location, called index, starts at 0
# To get first item, my_list[0]



# Dictionary
# Allows you to store data as key-value pairs. Basically, your index, called a key can
# be a word, not a number
# Format: my_dictionary = {key1:value1,key2:value2,key3:value3} etc.
# To get an item, my_dictionary[key]
